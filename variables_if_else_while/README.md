# C - Variables, if, else, while

## Description

This project introduces fundamental C programming concepts, including variables, arithmetic and logical operators, conditional statements, and loops. It covers essential elements to build a strong foundation in low-level programming.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will be able to:

- Understand and use arithmetic, logical, and relational operators.
- Work with different variable types: char, int, unsigned int.
- Implement if, if...else statements.
- Utilize the while loop effectively.
- Understand the ASCII character set.
- Compile C programs using gcc with proper flags.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Compilation: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, gcc with -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- Follow Betty coding style (betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl)
- No use of system calls
- All files should end with a new line

## Tasks Overview

- **Positive or Negative:** Print whether a random number is positive, negative, or zero.
- **Last Digit:** Determine and display the last digit of a random number.
- **Print Alphabet:** Print lowercase letters using putchar.
- **Print Alphabet (Upper & Lower):** Print lowercase and uppercase letters consecutively.
- **Print Alphabet (Except 'q' and 'e'):** Print lowercase letters, omitting 'q' and 'e'.
- **Print Numbers (Base 10):** Print single-digit numbers of base 10.
- **Print Numbers (Without Char):** Print single-digit numbers using only putchar.
- **Reverse Alphabet:** Print lowercase alphabet in reverse order.
- **Hexadecimal:** Print all numbers of base 16 in lowercase.
- **Combinations of Single Digits:** Print all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.
- **Combinations of Two Digits:** Print all unique two-digit combinations.
- **Combinations of Three Digits:** Print all unique three-digit combinations.
